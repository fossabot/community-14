# Contributing to k0sproject

Thank you for taking the time to make a contribution to k0s and related project. The following document is a set of guidelines and instructions for contributing to k0sproject and acts as a high level overview.

Each of the sub-project _may_ have their own more detailed instructions and guides for contributing.

In general, it is usually a good idea to first discuss the change you wish to make by opening an issue. For trivial things and fixes a direct pull request is of course good.

## Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct can be found in the link below. Please follow it in all your interactions with the k0sproject community.

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## GitHub Workflow

We use [GitHub flow] for all k0sproject sub-projects, so all code changes are tracked via Pull Requests. A detailed guide on the recommended workflow can be found below:

- [GitHub Workflow](./github_workflow.md)

## Code Testing

All submitted PRs go through a set of tests and reviews. You can run most of these tests *before* a PR is submitted.
In fact, we recommend it, because it will save on many possible review iterations and automated tests. Each sub-project will document their own testing principles and setups.

## License

In general, all the sub-projects follow the same licencing policy:

- All content residing under the "docs/" directory of the repository is licensed under "Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International" (CC-BY-SA-4.0). See docs/LICENCE for details.
- Content outside of the above mentioned directories or restrictions above is available under the "Apache License 2.0".

Each sub-project _may_ detail their own licencing scheme but we try to follow the above practices in all repositories.
