# K0s Community Code of Conduct

All members of the K0s community must abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

TL;DR; Be nice and supportive to others in all interactions. :smile:

## Reporting

reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at praj@mirantis.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
